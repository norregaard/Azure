# Info on firewall templates

fw-forced-tunneling-w-az.json ARM template installs a firewall that will run in forced tunneling mode and both the firewall and the public IP will run in all 3 availability zones (it requires that a firewall policy is already in place as well as a VNet and 2 x AzureFirewallSubnets)
